General Cluster*
===============

A clustering program that allows a user to import 2D data, display it, and cluster it into k groups.

About .2d data
--------------
A file format that has no significant use other than being easy to parse, 2d data is what allows the clustering program to run.

2d data is a set of points of the form "Name (Integer, Integer)". As of now, each point should be on its own line within the file.
